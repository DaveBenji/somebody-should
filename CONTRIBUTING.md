_testing contrib guidelines - this file will be edited several times today_

DoES Liverpool relies on active participation from the community - if you see something that needs doing, [JFDI](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI).

> It's better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven't done. (:

If it's something you are currently unable to do, [create a ticket](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/new) to see if someone else can do it, but follow these guidelines for great justice...

### S.M.A.R.T.

Any issues you create should be:

* **Specific** – what specifically needs to be done, and why?
* **Measurable** – how do we track progress or confirm success?
* **Achievable** – it has to be something achievable; otherwise, find a workaround
* **Responsible** – who is going to do it, or what skills are required?
* **Timescale** – when do we need to do it, how important is it?

More infos: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)

### Issue Status

Issues can be either open or closed. Newly created issues are automatically "open".

Resolve issues should always be closed. You can close issues using the button in the comments area of the issue detail screen.

A closed issue can be reopened if desired - please add a comment stating _why_ you reopened it.

### Stale Issues

To ensure that _all_ issues are processed, we periodically mark derelict issues as "Stale"... and then the clock starts ticking; if no further action is taken within ~1 month, the issue will be closed as [5: Won't Do]().

If you want to "un-stale" an issue:

* Remove the `4: Stale` label
* Add a comment stating why the issue should remain open.
* Make sure the issue is S.M.A.R.T.

### Issue Labels

Issues are labeled to help organise them.

You can add labels from the link in the sidebar on issue detail screens, and you can also see a [list of all labels here](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels) (clicking one shows all open issues with that label).

> Tip: When adding/removing labels from the issue detail screen, there's a search box at top of the label list that helps find specific labels. For example, if you're issue is something to do with a room, type "room" and it will filter the list to labels that contain the word "Room". Or type "do" to to filter to the main priority labels, etc.

We have several flavours of label to choose from...

**Priority**

Priority labels are loosely-based on the [MoSCoW Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) and start with a number denoting the priority. There should be only one of these labels per issue:

* [0: Triage]() - requires review by DoES team
* [1: Must Do]() - mission critical issues
* [2: Should Do]() - important tasks
* [3: Could Do]() - "nice to have" stuff
* [4: Stale]() - see Stale Issues above
* [5: Won't Do]() - things we decided not to do

**Location**

Add location labels when an issue relates to a specific part of the building or a room.

Building:

* [Building]() - anything not convered by any of the following labels in this section
* [Building: Parking]()

Rooms:

> TODO: Floorplan image ([draft here](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/432#issuecomment-298172301))

* [Room: Dinky]()
* [Room: Fridge]()
* [Room: Hotdesks (main room)]()
* [Room: Kitchen]()
* [Room: Recycling]()
* [Room: Room29 (permadesks)]()
* [Room: Workshop]()

**Tools**

These labels actually refer to machines (big tools), but "tools" takes up less screen space (: We name most equipment, the names are shown in brackets (eg. "Gerald" is the big laser cutter, "Sophia" is the small laser cutter).

* [Tool: 3D Printer - RepRap]()
* [Tool: 3D Printer - Ultimaker Extended]()
* [Tool: 3D Printer - Ultimaker 2]()
* [Tool: 3D Printer - UP3 (Rose)]()
* [Tool: 3D Printer - UP3 (Violet)]()
* [Tool: 3D Printer - Other]() - any not listed above
* [Tool: Bandsaw]()
* [Tool: Dinky]()
* [Tool: Laser Cutter - Large (Gerald)]()
* [Tool: Laser Cutter - Small (Sophia)]()
* [Tool: Polargraph (Tosca)]()
* [Tool: Proxxon CNC Mill]()
* [Tool: Solder Station (Electronics Workbench)]()
* [Tool: Vac-Former (Victor)]()
* [Tool: Vinyl Cutter & Plotter (Roland Rat)]()
