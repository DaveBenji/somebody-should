_testing contrib guidelines - this file will be edited several times today_

DoES Liverpool relies on active participation from the community - if you see something that needs doing, [JFDI](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI).

If it's something you are currently unable to do, [create a ticket](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/new) to see if someone else can do it, but follow these guidelines for great justice:

### Be S.M.A.R.T.

* **Specific** – what specifically needs to be done, and why?
* **Measurable** – how do we track progress or confirm success?
* **Achievable** – it has to be something achievable; otherwise, find a workaround
* **Responsible** – who is going to do it? (either a person or skill set)
* **Timescale** – when do we need to do it? (see note on issue labels below)

More infos: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)

### Issue labels

We use issue labels to group related issues, and also to determine issue priority.

* TODO
