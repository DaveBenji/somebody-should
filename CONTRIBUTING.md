DoES Liverpool relies on active participation from the community - if you see something that needs doing, [JFDI](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI).

> It's better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven't done. (:

If it's something you are currently unable to do, [create a ticket](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/new) to see if someone else can do it, but follow these guidelines for great justice...

### S.M.A.R.T.

Any issues you create should be:

* **Specific** – what specifically needs to be done, and why?
* **Measurable** – how do we track progress or confirm success?
* **Achievable** – it has to be something achievable; otherwise, find a workaround
* **Responsible** – who is going to do it, or what skills are required?
* **Timescale** – when do we need to do it, how important is it?

More infos: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)

### Issue Status

Issues can be either open or closed. Newly created issues are automatically "open".

Resolve issues should always be closed. You can close issues using the button in the comments area of the issue detail screen.

A closed issue can be reopened if desired - please add a comment stating _why_ you reopened it.

### Stale Issues

To ensure that _all_ issues are processed, we periodically mark derelict issues as "Stale"... and then the clock starts ticking; if no further action is taken within ~1 month, the issue will be closed as `5: Won't Do`.

If you want to "un-stale" an issue:

* Remove the `4: Stale` label
* Add a comment stating why the issue should remain open.
* Make sure the issue is S.M.A.R.T.

### Issue Labels

Issues are labeled to help organise them.

You can add labels from the link in the sidebar on issue detail screens, and you can also see a [list of all labels here](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels) (clicking one shows all open issues with that label).

> Tip: When adding/removing labels from the issue detail screen, there's a search box at top of the label list that helps find specific labels. For example, if you're issue is something to do with a room, type "room" and it will filter the list to labels that contain the word "Room". Or type "do" to to filter to the main priority labels, etc.

We have several flavours of label to choose from...

**Priority**

Priority labels are loosely-based on the [MoSCoW Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) and start with a number denoting the priority. There should be only one of these labels per issue:

* [0 - Triage](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/0%20-%20Triage) - requires review by DoES team
* [1 - Must DoES](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/1%20-%20Must%20DoES) - mission critical issues
* [2 - Should DoES](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/2%20-%20Should%20DoES) - important tasks
* [3 - Could DoES](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/3%20-%20Could%20DoES) - "nice to have" stuff
* [4 - Stale](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/4%20-%20Stale) - see Stale Issues above
* [5 - Won't DoES](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/5%20-%20Won%27t%20DoES) - things we decided not to do

You can view an agile board of issues sorted in to these priorities via our [Huboard](https://huboard.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should).

**Location**

Add location labels when an issue relates to a specific part of the building or a room.

Building:

* [Building](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Building) - anything not convered by any of the following labels in this section
* [Building: Parking](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Building%3A%20Parking)

Rooms:

> TODO: Floorplan image ([draft here](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/432#issuecomment-298172301))

* [Room: Dinky](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Dinky)
* [Room: Fridge](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Fridge)
* [Room: Hotdesks (main room)](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Hotdesks%20%28main%20room%29)
* [Room: Kitchen](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Kitchen)
* [Room: Recycling](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Recycling)
* [Room: Room29 (permadesks)](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Room29%20%28Permadesks%29)
* [Room: Workshop](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Room%3A%20Workshop)

**Tools**

Before using the tool labels (see later), there are some other labels that can be used in conjunction with them:

* [Broken](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/Broken) - if this label is associated with a tool label, the tool will show as Broken on the [Status page](http://status.doesliverpool.com/).
* [Maintenance](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/maintenance) - indicates routine, non-critical maintenance of the tool
* [Bug](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/labels/bug) - indicates ad-hoc / transient maintenance required for the tool (but won't mark the tool as Broken on the Status page)

These labels actually refer to machines (big tools), but "tools" takes up less screen space (: We name most equipment, the names are shown in brackets (eg. "Gerald" is the big laser cutter, "Sophia" is the small laser cutter).

Note: If any of the tool labels are deleted, renamed or new ones added, you will need to update the [Status page `config.json` file](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/status/blob/master/config.json) to reflect those changes.
