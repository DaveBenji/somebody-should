Please make sure your issue is S.M.A.R.T.
* Specific – what specifically needs to be done, and why?
* Measurable – how do we track progress or confirm success?
* Achievable – it has to be something achievable; otherwise, find a workaround
* Responsible – who is going to do it? (either a person or skill set)
* Timescale – when do we need to do it?

You can delete this template text, it's just here as a gentle reminder (:
