Somebody Should
===============

A place to collect issues/suggestions/to-do items for the physical space at DoES Liverpool

There isn't any source code for the main space, we're just using this to track issues.

If the project you're reporting the issue under has got source code, for example, the Doorbots [https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/doorbot-setup] then raise the issue there instead.

Anyone can create new issues.  Similarly, anyone is allowed to do the work to fix them :-)

We are tracking this repository in HuBoard, at [https://huboard.com/DoESliverpool/somebody-should]. Here, you'll find all the issues handily organised into three categories - Money Money Money, The Time Is Now and Wouldn't It Be Nice - according to urgency. Money Money Money is for issues related to the ongoing sustainability of DoES, and the things we can do to help increase visibility; The Time Is Now is for issues that need to be dealt with and closed as soon as possible; and Wouldn't It Be Nice is where things go when they would be a good addition to DoES, but aren't affecting anything too much by not being in place yet.

If you feel like you have the ability and time to take lead on any issue, just let us know.

Use labels to mark the issues with any suitable tags, so that it's easy for someone to find all the outstanding bugs, or all the things related to the workshop, or similar.  Create new labels if there's a class of issue that we're missing.
