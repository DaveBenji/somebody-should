Somebody Should
===============

A place to collect issues/suggestions/to-do items for the physical space at DoES Liverpool

There isn't any source code for the main space, we're just using this to track issues.

If the project you're reporting the issue under has got source code, for example, the Doorbots [https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/doorbot-setup] then raise the issue there instead.

Anyone can create new issues.  Similarly, anyone is allowed to do the work to fix them :-)

Use labels to mark the issues with any suitable tags, so that it's easy for someone to find all the outstanding bugs, or all the things related to the workshop, or similar.  Create new labels if there's a class of issue that we're missing.
